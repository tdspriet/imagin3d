{% if ctx.content_type == "text" %}
You are given a text snippet from a design moodboard. Your task is to convert this text into a descriptive text that captures all the content and meaning while making it suitable for semantic matching and retrieval.

Preserve all key information, themes, concepts, and details from the original text. The description should be clear, comprehensive, and retain the essence of the original content.

Text to describe:
{{ ctx.text }}

{% elif ctx.content_type == "images" %}
You are given {{ ctx.num_images }} image(s) from a design moodboard. Your task is to create a detailed textual description that captures all visual content, design elements, colors, composition, style, and any other relevant details visible in the image(s).

Be thorough and descriptive. Include:
- Visual elements and objects present
- Colors, textures, and materials
- Composition and layout
- Style and aesthetic qualities
- Any text or symbols visible
- Overall mood or atmosphere

The description should be comprehensive enough that someone could understand the visual content without seeing the images.

{% endif %}

Provide a detailed description that preserves all content.
